# DEEP-LEARNING-MODEL
I learned what deep learning models are used for, and I worked with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to build, train, and evaluate a CNN model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. I also worked with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), training a GAN to generate realistic images of handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.
